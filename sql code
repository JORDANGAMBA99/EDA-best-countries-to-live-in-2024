-- Quality of life
-- Which countries have the highest and lowest World Happiness scores in 2022?

select country,WorldHappiness2022

group by country,WorldHappiness2022
order by WorldHappiness2022 desc

Our data for happiness index only takes into account 41 african countries no matter we can use this to justify our theory
select happiness_by_population.country,
best_countries_to_live_in_2024.hdi2021,
best_countries_to_live_in_2024.worldhappiness2022
from best_countries_to_live_in_2024 join happiness_by_population
on best_countries_to_live_in_2024.country = happiness_by_population.country
group by best_countries_to_live_in_2024.hdi2021,
happiness_by_population.country,
best_countries_to_live_in_2024.worldhappiness2022
order by best_countries_to_live_in_2024.hdi2021 desc

The results are mixed in general as the top 3 african countries have a higher happiness score 
but generally we have a mixed bag of results

Do countries with lower population density tend to have higher happiness scores?

select country,population_density,worldhappiness2022
from best_countries_to_live_in_2024
where worldhappiness2022 > 5
group by country,population_density,worldhappiness2022
order by population_density asc

## Yes it is true from my query that the countries with lower population density tend to have a higher happiness score
The below article proves my hypothesis from the query

# This does not mean that lower population density = increase happiness score

How does population growth rate impact a country's overall quality of life?
â€¢	Are countries experiencing rapid population growth less likely to have high World Happiness scores?
Yeahh

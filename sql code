select country,WorldHappiness2022
from best_countries_to_live_in_2024
group by country,WorldHappiness2022
order by WorldHappiness2022 desc

-- How do population density, land area, and population growth rate correlate with the World Happiness Index?

- We first of all try to aggregate with population_density to see if their is a coorelation
- Between population_density and Worldhappiness score
- There is no coorelation whatsoever

 --- Also we checked the happiness coorelation with population 
 --- In this query we highlighted Africa with respect to population adn arranged dit in desc or asc
 --- The worldhappiness score varied as most african countries have a low score apart from Mauritius
 --- Mauritius has the highest score
 --- Therefore population or even population density is not a factor that affects happiness
